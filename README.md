# My Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains my machine learning projects built with Python and Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch (later)

The goal of this repository is to learn machine learning by building projects with known libraries, and after that from scratch (with only numpy).

## Projects

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Image Classification
